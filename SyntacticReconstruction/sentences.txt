A library can issue loan items.
System shutdown in twenty minutes.
A customer is termed as a member and is given a membership card.
It caters to the needs of customers.
Each membership card has a unique member number.
The customer’s name, address, date of birth and other such details also need to be recorded.
The library is divided into a number of sections for various subjects.
Each such section has a classification mark.
A loan item is distinguished by a bar code.
This bar code is unique to the loan item.
The loan items can be of two types namely language tapes and books.
Each language tape has a title language (e.g. French), and level (e.g. beginner).
Similarly a book can be identified by a title, and author(s).
A customer may borrow up to a maximum of 8 items at one time.
An item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend a current loan.
While issuing an item, the customer's membership number is scanned via a bar code reader.
If membership validation succeeds and the no of loan items is less than 8, the book bar code is read, either via the bar code reader.
If the item can be issued (e.g. not reserved) the item is stamped and then issued.
The library also supports the facility for an item to be searched.
The library database is updated on daily basis.
